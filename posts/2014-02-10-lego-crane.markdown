I have been a LEGO fan for as long as I can remember. 
Some memories include:
- Having my Legos taken away because I left them out and my mom stepped on them.
- Losing half of my Legos because my sister would cry and complain that I took her share.

That said, I was obligated to go see the new Lego movie yesterday. 
I'm not sure if it was a kids movie or not, or for that matter, whether I'm still a kid for still enjoying Legos so much. 
Regardless, I loved the movie and everyone should go see it.

<td style="border: none; padding: 5px">Being an impulse buyer, and having an adrenaline rush from watching 1.5 hours of action packed LEGO fun, the only natural place to go after such an epic movie is Toys 'R Us, and buy the most expensive LEGO set they had. 
This time I bought the enormous (<a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Mobile-Crane-MK-II-42009" target="blank">LEGO Technic Mobile Crane MK II (#42009)</a>). 
The complexity and intricate detail made every penny of the 230 dollars well worth it. 
It![](../images/lego/bulldozer/bulldozer_02.jpg) contains two gear boxes, side stabilizers, a fully functioning crane, and just about everything else you would imagine a crane having. 
All motorized! (6 Wii-mote batteries sacrificed their lives to see this creation come to life) Six manuals of fun.</td>

I was also very happy/relieved when I managed to successfully assemble everything without technical errors. 
I can only imagine the fury and difficulty that would ensue if you messed something in the gear box but didn't discover it until the end. Constant testing is key.


Note that this set has 2,606 pieces and if you are planning on sleeping you should start this around lunchtime. 
I made the mistake of thinking this would take 2-3 hours. 
After being bent over for hours, searching for pieces, making stupid mistakes, and being sleep-deprived, it ended up taking me 10.5 hours!
I recorded the entire build while listening to my favorite game-tracks: Donkey Kong Country, Chrono Trigger, and Super Metroid music.
This was to help ensure that I passed my DC 20 will and fortitude saves to persevere and finish.

Here are some other random pictures of its development.

Here is the 10.5-hour build video compressed into 30 min + random music. Well, apparently I violated copyright with the music and the sound is stripped.
