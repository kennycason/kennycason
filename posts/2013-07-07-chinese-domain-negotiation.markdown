Today I was online helping a friend purchase a domain, which was owned by a Chinese gentlemen. 

He was asking $7999 for a domain that we knew was valued somewhere around $1000-4000 (As the same domain was being auctioned by him on another site!)

Clearly overpriced, We decided to directly mail him and haggle a bit, which is very common when negotiating for domain names, especially because the value of domains is very subjective to begin with.

Here was the initial conversation:

us:
<blockquote>Hi,
I'm interested in the domain name [DOMAIN].com.
How much do you want to sell it for?
Best,</blockquote>

him:
<blockquote>HI
[DOMAIN].com  7999 USD</blockquote>

We only wanted to pay around $1000 dollars, Also due to his email alias we found out he was Chinese, so I sent the following message:

<blockquote>先生您好,
谢谢您快回信给我。我觉得一千块钱差不多。给我一个您认为最低能接受的价格吧。</blockquote>

To which he promptly responded:

<blockquote>感谢你的关注，1000 块 你能买到任何双单词 CVCV COM吗？ 如果有的话请你选择其他域名购买。
7999 美元是最优惠的价格了！</blockquote>

At this point I was a bit unsure how to pursue, as he was unwilling to even budge a dollar. As such there were a few questions going through my head:

1. Was he offended by the low initial offer? If so, then why did he have the same domain name up for bid for such a low price on another site?
2. Was my Chinese not persuasive enough?
3. Was he offended that I messaged him in Chinese?
4. Does he just drive a hard bargain hoping we will just agree to pay $7999?

If I am to reply, how should I go about doing so?
Regardless, I didn't see too much use in further negotiations so decided to just respond with:

<blockquote>先生,
好的。我明白了。对不起打扰你。如果以后改变想法的话请您发邮件给我。
谢谢</blockquote>

Thoughts? 
中国人,求有议价经验的人给我指教一下我怎么才能成功。举一些例子可以帮我很多。
谢谢:)
