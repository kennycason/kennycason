This was a simple program I wrote that Displays 3D points. It does so by simply projecting a 3D (vector) into 2D.
The Jar file can be downloaded here: <a href="/code/java/graph3D/Graph3D.jar">Graph3D.jar</a>

Before looking at the source, let's take a look at some of the fundamental mathematics behind the software.
<b>rotations</b> - Rotations in this software simple geometric transformations based around an unmoving center axis. Below are the three rotation matrices for each axis, X, Y, and Z, respectively. Every operation can be found in Transform.java below.

<br/><b>Rotate Around X,Y, or Z Axis</b>

<table width="500px"><tr><td>
<div class="latex">
rotX = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0       \\\\
0 & cos(\\theta) & -sin(\\theta)      \\\\
0 & sin(\\theta) & cos(\\theta)   
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>
</td><td>
<div class="latex">
rotY = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}
cos(\\theta) & 0 & sin(\\theta)       \\\\
0 & 1 & 0      \\\\
-sin(\\theta) & 0 & cos(\\theta)      \\\\   
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<div class="latex">
rotZ = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}
cos(\\theta) & -sin(\\theta) & 0       \\\\
sin(\\theta) & cos(\\theta) & 0      \\\\
0 & 0 & 1      \\\\   
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>
</td><td></td></tr></table>
 It is also important to know that every point in our world is defined by:
<div class="latex">
\\vec{p} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}
x       \\\\
y      \\\\
z      \\\\   
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>
This can be seen in Point3D.java below. (Which is synonymous to a Vector in this application.)

<b>Rotate Around Arbitrary Axis</b>

The above rotations are all rotations about either the X,Y, or Z axises. But another common and more complicated rotation is to rotate Vector/Point A around Vector/Point B.

Here are the Steps:

1. the Vector that is being rotated around must be NORMALIZED. This can be done very easily

<table width="300px">
<tr><td>
<div class="latex">
d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
</div>
 </td><td>
<div class="latex">
\\hat{p} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}
x/d       \\\\
y/d      \\\\
z/d      \\\\   
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>
</td></tr>
</table>

2. next, using quaternions, perform the rotation. Where:

<div class="latex">
\\hat{p} = ai + bj + ck
</div>
<div class="latex">
q0 = cos(\\theta/2),  q1 = sin(\\theta/2) a,  q2 = sin(\\theta/2) b,  q3 = sin(\\theta/2) c,  (\\theta\\ is\\ in\\ radians)
</div>

The rotation matrix evaluates to the following:

<div class="latex">
rotAB = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}
(q0^2 + q1^2 - q2^2 - q3^2) & 2(q1q2 - q0q3) & 2(q1q3 + q0q2)       \\\\
2(q2q1 + q0q3) & (q0^2 - q1^2 + q2^2 - q3^2) & 2(q2q3 - q0q1)       \\\\
2(q3q1 - q0q2) & 2(q3q2 + q0q1) & (q0^2 - q1^2 - q2^2 + q3^2)       \\\\
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>

<br/><b>Example:</b>

Suppose we have point:
<div class="latex">
\\vec{p} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}
1       \\\\
2      \\\\
3      \\\\   
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>

and we would like to rotate <span class="latex">\\vec{p}</span> by 30Â° around the X axis.

<div class="latex" width="800px">
\\vec{p}_{new} = (rotX)\\vec{p} =
\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0       \\\\
0 & cos(\\theta) & -sin(\\theta)      \\\\
0 & sin(\\theta) & cos(\\theta)        \\\\
\\end{array}\\right]
\\left[\\begin{array}{c}
x      \\\\
y      \\\\
z      \\\\
\\end{array}\\right]
=
\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0       \\\\
0 & cos(30) & -sin(30)      \\\\
0 & sin(30) & cos(30)        \\\\
\\end{array}\\right]
\\left[\\begin{array}{c}
1      \\\\
2      \\\\
3      \\\\
\\end{array}\\right]
</div>

And finally, to project the 3D points onto a 2D canvas after performing a rotation, a simple way is to simply ignore the Z coordinate and draw the point based on it's X and Y coordinates. However this is assuming that you're projecting it on to the screen as if you are looking straight at it.
