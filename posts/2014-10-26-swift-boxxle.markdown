Yesterday for the Arkansas Dev Hackathon I decided to try my hands at the Swift programming language. Fortunately I was able to find many online tutorials to slingshot my studies. As a programming language Swift is certainly a lot easier to use than Objective C and with almost no pain I was able to program a simple Hello World program with a ninja throwing shurikens at monsters! (Tutorial <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/84434/sprite-kit-swift-tutorial-beginners" target="blank">here</a>)

All code can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kennycason/swift_boxxle" target="blank">here</a>

Simply touch in the direction you want to move. For example to move right, touch to the right of the character.
I really tried hard not to use the Virtual D-Pad, per reading many blogs on mobile game design. :)

This clone features:

1. 40 levels from the original Boxxle (GameBoy)
2. Touch [next] to go to the next level
3. Touch [reset] to reset the level in case you make a mistake
4. Step counter for each level

This clone doesn't include:

1. Level passwords
2. Walking animations (I couldn't find the sprites)
3. A real title screen
