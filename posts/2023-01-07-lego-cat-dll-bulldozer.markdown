My LEGO Technic Saga continues with the massive Cat® D11 Bulldozer.
Prior to this set, my favorite LEGO set was the [LEGO Technic Crane (#42009)](/posts/2014-02-10-lego-crane.html).

With 3,854 pieces, this set is HUGE. 
Instead of "Binge Building" per my typical fashion, I spread this project out over a few weeks.
I think it made the build more enjoyable, and I know my back appreciated it.å

The Bulldozer is remotely controlled via the LEGO Technic CONTROL+ Mobile App.
There are numerous tools for calibration, two different interfaces for controlling the Bulldozer.

I had one other curiosity around the platform's extensibility, and whether I could write custom code (Python) to control the Bulldozer.
I stumbled across [this](https://pybricks.com/projects/sets/technic/42131-cat-bulldozer/powered-up-remote/) post on the PyBricks website.
It looks very promising and seems to support what I had in mind. 
As a life-long amateur Lego tinkerer, and computer programmer by profession, I was very pleased to see how far LEGO has advanced their platform.

After the Bulldozer is built, the next steps are to use the LEGO Technic CONTROL+ Mobile App to connect to the Bulldozer and then perform calibration.
I had no issues connecting, however calibration failed, and the cause wasn't immediately clear from the error message.
My first step was to re-calibrate, and pay more attention to all the gears & shafts.
Upon further examination, I was able to manually confirm that a slidable cog seems to installed upside-down.

Thought there was still a problem.
I had no idea how I was going to take it apart.
There aren't really instructions online for such specific teardowns.

I didn't spend much time mulling over the decision and began taking it apart in the largest chunks I could.

I finally got the Bulldozer opened up so that I can swap the gear. 
Afterwards, I re-assembled everything, and hoped that there weren't any other undiscovered errors.

Calibration Complete!
