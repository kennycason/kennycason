Minesweeper is written in Java.

<b>Note:</b> I built this engine a long time ago when I didn't know any better, I recommend using LibGDX. I ported this implementation to LibGDX: [here](posts/2015-12-29-libgdx-minesweeper.html)

This is a small demo I built using my (uncomplete) Java 2D Gaming Engine.
