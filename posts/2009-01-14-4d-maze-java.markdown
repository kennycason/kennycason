title: 4D Maze - (Java)

This is a simple implementation of a 4D maze written in Java. As of now it is entirely text based however, a simple GUI is currently under development. Either way, this simple implementation should be useful to modify and/or build off of.
The algorithm used to generate the map is quite simple and always generates a perfect maze.
<blockquote>
<b>1.</b> Randomly choose a starting room<br/>
<b>2.</b> Add all surrounding rooms that have not been visited, or  to a list<br/>
<b>3.</b> While their are rooms in the list randomly select one<br/>
<b>4.</b> Set the room to visited, and start again from step 2 using the current room<br/>
</blockquote>
Note: the Java version used in this implementation uses recursion to do this.
This code has not been thoroughly checked for possible bugs, and I am sure there is a more efficient method to write a 4D maze. But, at the very least, it is flexible and each room of the maze is of class type Room4D and should be easy to modify.
The Jar file can be downloaded here: <a href="/code/java/maze4D/Maze4D.jar">Maze4D.jar</a>
To run from the command line:
<blockquote>java -jar Maze4D.java dimXYZU</blockquote>
Ex:
<blockquote>java -jar Maze4D.java 5</blockquote>
This initializes a 5x5x5x5 maze. Start = (0,0,0,0), Finish = (5,5,5,5)
that's 5^4 rooms, 625 rooms, that's a lot of rooms to navigate in 4D. :) 

<blockquote>java -jar Maze4D.java dimX dimY dimZ dimU</blockquote>
Ex:
<blockquote>java -jar Maze4D.java 5 5 3 2</blockquote>
This initializes a 5x5x3x2 maze. Start = (0,0,0,0), Finish = (5,5,3,2)
5x5x3x2 = 150 rooms.

<blockquote>java -jar Maze4D.java</blockquote>
creates a default maze of dimensions 4x4x4x4

Note: be careful not to load a 4D maze that's too big or Java will run out of memory, depending on your Java settings. For example creating a room that is 10x10x10x10, 10000 rooms, will likely cause an error caused by using too much memory. besides, a 10000 room is very, very complicated, especially in 4D.<br/>
