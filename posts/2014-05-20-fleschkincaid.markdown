This is a simple implementation of the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests in Java. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests" target="blank">Wikipedia</a>, The Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability tests are readability tests designed to indicate comprehension difficulty when reading a passage of contemporary academic English.

GitHub Source Code: <a href="https://github.com/kennycason/fleschkincaid" target="blank">here</a>

The basic algorithm is as follows:

```java
final double f1 = 206.835;
final double f2 = 84.6;
final double f3 = 1.015;
final double r1 = (double) syllableCount / (double) wordCount;
final double r2 = (double) wordCount / (double) sentences.size();

final double score = f1 - (f2 * r1) - (f3 * r2);
```
