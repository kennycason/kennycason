I have spent the past 4-6 months playing with Haskell on the side. While I've yet come to the conclusion that one paradigm of programming is inherently better than the other, I have at least found it very intellectually rewarding and exciting to take a step back, and try to implement algorithms, data structures, and other hackings using a functional programmer's mindset. I can't say that I've fully grasped everything but I imagine it's just a function of time.
